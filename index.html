        <p>In November of 2028, students that were in grades 3 to 6 in 2019 will be eligible to vote in the next U.S. presidential election.</p>

        <p>In 2019, Donald Trump was near the end of his first term as president, and now, with the results of the most recent election, he is the president-elect, preparing himself for his second term beginning in January of next year. By the end of his next term, many people that were elementary school students during his first time as president will have the opportunity to vote for his successor. </p>

       <p> Politics is and will continue to be one of the most prevalent topics discussed among Americans. In the United States, politics as a field of study is a topic mostly discussed by adults. Most would believe that this is because, in the U.S., people are not allowed to vote until they turn 18, the age they become a legal adult. But these discourses might happen among a wider range of people than assumed. The opinions held by elementary school students on politics, despite being young, could possibly be maintained well past their childhood and into adulthood.</p>

       <p>“Political views begin to form in childhood. Children learn who political leaders are and develop attitudes about both leaders and political institutions,” said authors at <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-do-kids-think-of-the-president-126575"> The Conversation</a>

       <p>“One of the ways that political identities start to become crystallized is when these events happen that force the conversations, whether that is the Black Lives Matter protests or having an election in school.  It forces people to crystallize and then they are much more likely to repeat that [party choice] in future elections,” said <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/directory/emily-thorson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily Thorson</a>, a professor of political science at Syracuse University.</p>

       <p>Five academics, in 2019, created a study on how children view the American presidency for “Public Opinion Quarterly.” Students in first grade to sixth grade divided into four sections of the United States were surveyed: the Midwest, the South, Northeast suburbs and Northeast small cities. Despite many adults avoiding the topic of politics with children, this study resulted in multiple surprising findings among the young students. </p>

        <p>When researchers asked “What kinds of things do you think the President does?,” third graders were the largest number of respondents who answered the question with the most factual description. Out of 328 students, who gave a factual description for this question, third graders made up about a third of respondents compared to the rest of their peers.</p>

        <p>Typically around the ages of 8 and 9, third graders provided more factual information on the president, outperforming sixth grade students who are ages eleven and twelve. As they are further along with their education, children in sixth grade would be believed to have more knowledge on the president and politics in comparison to a student in third grade, but the data shows that that is not the case.</p>

        <p>In this study, examples of factual descriptions found in an article on The Conversation include, “Fills paperwork, deals with court, executes the laws,” and “military leader, keep US safe, make laws.”  But students involved in the study also answered with negative descriptions. For example, one student said, “Plans to build a wall in Mexico, plan World War III,” specifically describing Donald Trump.</p>

</script>

        <p>Later in the study, when researchers asked, “What kind of job has the President been doing?,” on average, most students ranked the current president (Donald Trump) as doing a very bad job.  Out of 130 students who rated the current president's job as very bad, students living in the South made up a little more than a third of those respondents, making this group of first grade to sixth grade students the most likely to rank the president's job as very bad at the time.</p>

        <p>In the age of extreme polarization in the U.S., one can confidently say that southern states are primarily red and vote for Republican candidates, while northern states are more blue and vote for Democratic candidates. But even though this is usually the case, higher numbers of elementary students in the South said that Donald Trump, a Republican president, was doing a very bad job as president in 2019. </p>

        <p>In this study, data collected from 2019 was compared against data collected from a similar study in the 1950s. Overall, elementary school students’ responses on the president and politics in general have gotten more negative in this almost 70-year period.</p>

        <p>"Adults have stronger negative feelings about the opposing party. Adults are much more likely now to criticize members of the opposing party. I would imagine that this would translate to kids.  Maybe directly or indirectly. It makes sense that if adults have this increased animosity or hostility towards out-party members than kids would as well," said Thorson.</p>

        <p>As a mom to elementary school students herself, Thorson tries to include politics in conversations with her children as much as she can. But as a political science professor, she does so by describing the policy side to her kids rather than speaking on hot topics in the media. She encourages more parents to help their children understand the many roles that the government plays in our everyday lives and then connect that back to politics, making the entire process easier to grasp for young minds.</p>

        <p>“We might disagree with some of the ones [policies] our party has and disagree with other ones, but finding out about policies is the first step in figuring out where you land in terms of partisanship.”</p>
